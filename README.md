I used a bunch of sources:

1. **An Introduction to Chip-8 emulation using Rust** ([https://github.com/aquova/chip8-book]) by aquova: This comprehensive guide provides a step-by-step approach to building a Chip-8 emulator in Rust.
2. **Bitwise Command Line** ([https://developer.4d.com/]) offers valuable resources on bitwise operations.
3. **Write a Chip-8 Emulator** by Tobias Vermeulen ([https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/]) delves into the process of creating a Chip-8 emulator.
4. **CHIP-8 Technical Reference** by Jean-Fran√ßois Verrnay ([http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM]) offers detailed specifications for the Chip-8 instruction set.
